## Workflow
- using chatgpt on two different levels: producing content and technical support
- Compare different queries in order to get the best summary
	- Shiny App: https://a88fuu-fabian-aiolfi.shinyapps.io/ChatGPT_Output_Evaluation/
- Voting record with summary and smart spider category values
	- Shiny App: https://a88fuu-fabian-aiolfi.shinyapps.io/abstimmungsverhalten/
- Evaluation

### Technical Aspects
- ChatGPT API (for summaries): v3.5
- ChatGPT for technical support and Shiny App: v4

## Discussion

### ChatGPT Output Evaluation
Generated Summary
- Which summary query was the best / most adequat?

Smart Spider Category Values
- eyeball the results, sample all 8 categories
- Is a direct comparison with current smart spider possible?
	- possible comparison: compare parliamentarian profile with with an average of their voting history? â†’ file under possible future work
- Is there a correlation between Yes/No votes and the level of a category value? E.g.: A parliamentarian tends to vote yes on an item of business that is below a certain value in the category?

Vote Decision
- Add feature where vote is compared to other parliamentarians in the same faction

### Technical Aspects
- Dangers of being dependent on one single API
	- alternative: huggingface open source models
- When querying smartvote values: Returns unstructured output

### Other
- Money spent on ChatGPT API
